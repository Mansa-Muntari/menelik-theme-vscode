# Overview
Menelik was designed with simplicity in mind. The theme uses contrasting shades of grey and minimal syntax colours to achieve a simple, clean visual appearance.

Personal customisations can be achieved using the _workbench.colorCustomizations_ and the _editor.tokenColorCustomizations_ in Visual Studio Code's user settings. More information on customisations can be found on [Visual Studio Code's documentation page on theming.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes)
